This project focuses on the development of a digital twin utilizing machine learning models for event detection in aquaponic systems, with the use of limited of training data. Specifically, a Decision Tree Classifier, a Gradient Boosting Classifier, and a k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier have been implemented to address the challenge of working with a small dataset. To enhance the accuracy of the models, feature extraction techniques have been employed. The successful fine-tuning of these models demonstrates the potential of machine learning in addressing the specific challenges posed by limited datasets. The integration of these models with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has the potential to streamline the monitoring process, reducing the complexity of managing these systems and the number of sensors required. This approach may also contribute to reducing stress for certain fish species that prefer darker environments, as it may minimize the need for human intervention, such as opening the tank lid for inspection. This work contributes to the growing body of research on the application of digital twins, machine learning and IoT in aquaponics, offering a promising path towards more sustainable and efficient food production systems. The main advantage of using sensors and digital twins is that they can show the status of the system in real time, supporting decision-making for a more efficient system and higher yields.
